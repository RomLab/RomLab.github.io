I have made an underfloor heating system. The system for regulation of zone heating of family house. This system is used in a family home. Proposed control system is based on Raspberry Pi with the Home Assistant system. The unit is fully controllable via web. Devices for controlling individual parts of the heating zone control and local room temperature sensors were selected or made within the system. 

I have made all devices in workroom [MacGyver SH][macgyver] (I used measuring devices, tools and others). This system consists of a central control unit, zone controlles, wall-mounted room temperature sensors. Everything is descripted in my [GitHub][system-for-underfloor-heating-v2.0]. There are all schematics, PCB, gerber data, 3D models of cases, G-code for 3D printer, pictures and others.
